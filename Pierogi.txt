Of course! Here's a step-by-step list to make pierogis at home:

Ingredients:

2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 large egg
1/2 cup sour cream
1/4 cup water
2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
Filling of your choice (e.g., mashed potatoes, cheese, sauerkraut, ground meat, etc.)
Optional toppings: caramelized onions, sour cream, butter, bacon bits, etc.

Instructions:

Prepare the Dough:
In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt.
In a separate bowl, whisk together the egg, sour cream, water, and melted butter until well combined.
Gradually pour the wet ingredients into the flour mixture, stirring with a spoon until a dough starts to form.
Once the dough becomes too stiff to mix with a spoon, transfer it to a floured surface and knead it by hand until smooth and elastic (about 5-7 minutes).

Rest the Dough:
Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and let it rest at room temperature for at least 30 minutes. This will make it easier to roll out later.

Prepare the Filling:
While the dough is resting, prepare your preferred filling. Common pierogi fillings include mashed potatoes, cheese, sauerkraut, and ground meat. Make sure the filling is cooled before using it for the pierogis.

Roll and Cut the Dough:
After resting, unwrap the dough and roll it out on a floured surface until it's about 1/8-inch thick.
Use a round cookie cutter or a drinking glass to cut circles out of the rolled dough. The size of the circles depends on your preference, but around 3 to 4 inches in diameter works well.

Fill and Seal the Pierogis:
Place a small spoonful of the filling in the center of each dough circle.
Fold the dough over the filling to create a half-moon shape and press the edges firmly to seal. You can use a little water on the edges to help them stick together.

Boil the Pierogis:
Bring a large pot of salted water to a gentle boil.
Carefully drop the pierogis into the boiling water in batches (about 5-7 at a time).
Cook the pierogis for about 3-5 minutes or until they float to the surface. This may vary slightly depending on the thickness of the dough.

Optional Sautéing:
For added flavor and texture, you can sauté the boiled pierogis in butter until they become slightly crispy and golden brown. This step is optional but highly recommended.

Serve and Enjoy:
Serve the pierogis hot with your favorite toppings, such as caramelized onions, a dollop of sour cream, butter, or bacon bits.
Enjoy your homemade pierogis!

Pierogis can be stored in the refrigerator for a few days and reheated by pan-frying them or gently microwaving them. They can also be frozen for longer storage; just make sure to lay them out in a single layer 
on a baking sheet and freeze before transferring to an airtight container or freezer bag.
